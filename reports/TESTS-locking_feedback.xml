  Scenario Outline: Failure feedback when trying to lock the vehicle with one door open -- @1.8 
    Given I do not have an authenticated key with me ... passed in 0.326s
    And my vehicle is 'locked' with no release buttons pressed ... passed in 3.230s
    And all doors are 'closed' ... passed in 1.088s
    Given the door 4 is 'unlocked' ... passed in 3.262s
    And the door 4 is closed ... passed in 0.262s
    When I press the vehicle 'lock' button ... passed in 0.659s
    Then all doors should be 'locked' ... passed in 1.070s
    And I should receive a locking confirmation feedback within '500' ms ... passed in 0.001s
