    Given I do not have an authenticated key with me ... passed in 0.310s
    And my vehicle is 'locked' with no release buttons pressed ... passed in 3.108s
    And all doors are 'closed' ... passed in 1.036s
    When I press the 'lock' button ... passed in 0.983s
    Then all doors should be 'locked' ... passed in 1.026s
    And I should receive a 'locking confirmation' feedback within '500' ms ... passed in 0.001s
