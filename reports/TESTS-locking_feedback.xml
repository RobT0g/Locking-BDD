  Scenario Outline: Failure feedback when trying to lock the vehicle with one door open -- @1.8 
    Given I do not have an authenticated key with me ... passed in 0.272s
    And my vehicle is 'locked' with no release buttons pressed ... passed in 3.108s
    And all doors are 'closed' ... passed in 1.036s
    Given the door 4 is 'unlocked' ... passed in 3.096s
    And the door 4 is closed ... passed in 0.311s
    When I press the vehicle 'lock' button ... passed in 0.628s
    Then all doors should be 'locked' ... passed in 1.030s
    And I should receive a locking confirmation feedback within '500' ms ... passed in 0.000s
