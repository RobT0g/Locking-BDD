  Scenario: Not auto relocking if unlock button is pressed twice
    Given I do not have an authenticated key with me ... passed in 0.253s
    And my vehicle is 'locked' with no release buttons pressed ... passed in 3.101s
    And all doors are 'closed' ... passed in 1.036s
    Given all doors are 'locked' ... passed in 2.059s
    And the vehicle 'unlock' button has been pressed ... passed in 0.628s
    And the vehicle 'unlock' button has been pressed ... passed in 0.628s
    When I wait '15' seconds ... passed in 15.001s
    Then all doors should be 'unlocked' ... passed in 1.025s
