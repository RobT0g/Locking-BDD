  Scenario: Not auto relocking if unlock button is pressed twice
    Given I do not have an authenticated key with me ... passed in 0.256s
    And my vehicle is 'locked' with no release buttons pressed ... passed in 3.144s
    And all doors are 'closed' ... passed in 1.040s
    Given all doors are 'locked' ... passed in 2.098s
    And the vehicle 'unlock' button has been pressed ... passed in 0.561s
    And the vehicle 'unlock' button has been pressed ... passed in 0.566s
    When I wait '15' seconds ... passed in 15.002s
    Then all doors should be 'unlocked' ... passed in 1.021s
