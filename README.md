# Locking-BDD
Locking system using BDD


# Setup
- Recommend using VSCode with the following extensions:
    - Python
    - Cucumber
    - Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support
    - Pytest BDD
    - Optional Extensions (actually everything is optional if you think about it):
        - Icons
        - MATLAB

- Create the python Virtual Environment by using the command `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate the environment with the command `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install all dependencies with the command `pip install -r reqs.txt`

To work with the simulink model you need to have Matlab (2024a or newer) installed. There's no special setup there as everything is set in the project.
